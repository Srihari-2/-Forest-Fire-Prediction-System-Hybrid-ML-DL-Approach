# -Forest-Fire-Prediction-System-Hybrid-ML-DL-Approach
A hybrid wildfire prediction system using CBFR, LSTM, and XGBoost models with a Linear Regression meta-learner. It analyzes historical and real-time data to predict forest fire risks accurately, supporting early warnings and proactive disaster management
# forest Fire Prediction System â€” Hybrid ML & DL Approach

A context-driven wildfire prediction system built using a hybrid architecture that combines machine learning and deep learning models. This project focuses on forecasting forest fire risks by analyzing historical weather data and real-time anomalies to support early warning systems and disaster response.

##  Features
- âœ… **CBFR (Context-Based Fire Risk Model):** Analyzes historical weather and wildfire data, detects anomalies using clustering techniques, and generates dynamic fire risk scores.  
- âœ… **LSTM Model:** Captures long-term temporal dependencies to identify wildfire trends over time.  
- âœ… **XGBoost Model:** Learns complex, non-linear patterns in fire behavior based on environmental features.  
- âœ… **Ensemble Meta-Learner:** Combines predictions from LSTM and XGBoost using Linear Regression for higher accuracy.  
- âœ… **Performance Evaluation:** Compared with Random Forest, achieving lower RMSE and improved prediction reliability.

##  Tech Stack
- **Languages/Frameworks:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, XGBoost  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Platform:** Google Colab  
- **Modeling:** Clustering, Time Series Analysis, Linear Regression Ensemble  

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Real-time fire risk estimation  
- Adaptive, region-specific forecasting  
- Better performance than traditional models (e.g., Random Forest)
